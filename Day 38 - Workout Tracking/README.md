# Day 38 - Workout tracking with Nutritionix and Sheety API

This Python script allows users to log their workout data from Nutritionix API to a Google Sheet using Sheety API.  
It prompts users to input their exercise details, sends the information to Nutritionix to get exercise data, and then logs the exercise details along with date and time into a specified Google Sheet.

## Setup
1. Obtain Nutritionix API credentials (APP_ID and API_KEY) and Google Sheets API credentials (Bearer ID).
2. Set up a Google Sheet with Sheety API integration.
3. Replace placeholders in the script with your API credentials, gender, weight, height, age, Google Sheet URL, and Bearer ID.

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Input the exercises you did when prompted.
3. The script fetches exercise data from Nutritionix.
4. Logs the exercise details, date, and time into the specified Google Sheet using Sheety API.

Make sure to replace **"YOUR_ID"**, **"YOUR_KEY"**, **"YOUR_GENDER"**, **"YOUR_KG"**, **"YOUR_HEIGHT"**, **"YOUR_AGE"**, **"YOUR SHEET URL"** and **"YOUR_BEARER_ID"** with your actual credentials and details.

Feel free to customize the script according to your needs and enhance its functionality. Happy exercising!
