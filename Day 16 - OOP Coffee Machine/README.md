# Day 16 - Object-Oriented Coffee Machine Simulator

This Python project is an object-oriented simulation of a coffee machine. The script encapsulates the coffee machine's functionality within classes, providing a modular and extensible design. Users can interact with the machine to order espresso, latte, or cappuccino while the program manages resources such as water, milk, coffee, and money.

**Usage:**
1. Run the script.  
2. Interact with the coffee machine using the object-oriented interface.  
3. Insert coins seamlessly through the OOP coin handling system.  
4. Enjoy your coffee with an enhanced and modular code structure!
