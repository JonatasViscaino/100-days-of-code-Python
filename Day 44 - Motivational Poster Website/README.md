# Day 44 - Motivational Poster Website

## Box-Model in CSS
The CSS file demonstrates the use of the box model to control the layout and spacing of elements. The **.meme** class (the div element), which encapsulates the content, is styled with properties like **width**, **margin**, **text-align**, and **font-family**.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to understand how the box model influences the arrangement of elements on the webpage. The motivational phrase, styled using the **h1** and **p** elements, is centered within the defined layout.

### Fonts:
Additionally, the project utilizes the 'Libre Baskerville' font from Google Fonts to enhance the typography.

Feel free to customize the content, styles, and images to create your own motivational posters. Enjoy experimenting with the box model in CSS!
