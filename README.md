# 100 Days of Code - Python Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository featuring projects inspired by the "100 Days of Python Coding Bootcamp" course by Angela Yu from <a href="https://appbrewery.com/">App Brewery</a>.

## About:  
This repository contains a collection of Python projects completed during the "100 Days of Python" coding journey. Each project is organized into specific folders, making it easy to explore and understand the code. The course provided a structured and hands-on approach to learning Python, and these projects showcase the practical application of the concepts covered.

## Contact:  
If you have any questions, feedback, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out to me. I'm here to help and discuss anything related to these projects.

Thank you for visiting!
