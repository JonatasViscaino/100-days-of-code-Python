# Day 61 - Advanced forms with Flask

## Building Advanced Forms with Flask-WTF

Welcome to Day 61 of the 100 Days of Code in Python challenge! In this project, I explore building advanced forms using Flask-WTF. Flask-WTF is an extension for Flask that integrates with the WTForms library, making it easier to handle forms in Flask applications.

### Project Overview

This session focuses on creating sophisticated forms with Flask-WTF to enhance the user experience in web applications. The project demonstrates features such as form validation, CSRF protection, and handling complex form structures.

### How to Run

To explore this project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask application with `python app.py`.
4. Open your web browser and visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
