# Day 37 - Pixela habit tracker

This Python script leverages the Pixela API (https://pixe.la/) to create a habit tracker, allowing users to visualize and track their daily habits. Key features include:

**User Creation**: Easily create a user account using the Pixela API by providing a username, token, and agreeing to the terms of service.

**Graph Creation**: Set up personalized graphs to track habits over time. Define graph properties such as name, unit, type, and color.

**Pixel Creation and Updates**: Log daily habits as pixels on the graph with specified quantities. Update existing pixels to reflect changes in habit progress.

**Pixel Deletion**: Remove unwanted or incorrect habit data by deleting pixels for specific dates.

To use, replace "YOUR_USERNAME", "YOUR_CREATED_TOKEN" and "YOUR_GRAPH_NAME" with your Pixela account details. Uncomment the relevant sections to execute user, graph, and pixel-related actions.

Note: Ensure proper handling of sensitive information like your Pixela token.
