# Day 25 - Guess U.S. States Game 

The U.S. States guessing game is an interactive Python program that utilizes the Turtle graphics library and Pandas for a fun and educational experience. Players are presented with a Turtle graphics window featuring a U.S. map background. The objective is to guess the names of U.S. states by entering them via user input. The program validates the guesses against a provided CSV file ("50_states.csv") containing state information, including coordinates.

Upon a correct guess, the program dynamically displays the guessed state's name on the map using Turtle graphics. The game continues until the player has successfully guessed all 50 states or chooses to exit by typing "Exit." In the latter case, a CSV file ("states_to_learn.csv") is generated, listing the states yet to be guessed.

This game combines entertainment with educational value, offering an engaging way to learn U.S. state names and their geographic locations. The visual representation of guessed states on the map enhances the learning experience, making it both enjoyable and informative.
