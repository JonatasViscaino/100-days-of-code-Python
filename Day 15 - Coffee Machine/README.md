# Day 15 - The Coffee Machine Simulator

This Python project simulates the behavior of a coffee machine. The script provides a user-friendly interface for ordering espresso, latte, or cappuccino. It keeps track of available resources such as water, milk, coffee, and money. Users can also request a report to view the current resource levels.

**Usage:**
1. Run the script.  
2. Input your coffee order or request a report.  
3. Insert coins when prompted.  
4. Enjoy your coffee!
